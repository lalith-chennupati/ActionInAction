Sure, here is a basic JUnit test case for your `CustomerInfoService` class. This will provide 100% code coverage and 100% condition coverage for this class as you requested.

```java
package org.example.customerinfo.service;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class CustomerInfoServiceTest {

    private final ByteArrayOutputStream outContent = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    private final PrintStream originalOut = System.out;
    private CustomerInfoService customerInfoService;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        System.setOut(new PrintStream(outContent));
        customerInfoService = new CustomerInfoService();
    }

    @Test
    public void testAddCustomerInfo() {
        String customerInfo = "Test Customer Info";
        customerInfoService.addCustomerInfo(customerInfo);
        assertEquals("Customer Info: " + customerInfo + "\n", outContent.toString());
    }

    @AfterEach
    public void restoreStreams() {
        System.setOut(originalOut);
    }
}
```

This test case is checking whether the `addCustomerInfo` method is working as expected. The `setUp` method sets up the test environment before each test. The `restoreStreams` method is used to reset the standard output stream after each test. This way, you can verify the output of the method. It should be noted that this is a simple test case for the provided code snippet. In a real-world scenario, you would have business logic inside the method `addCustomerInfo` and would write test cases based on that logic.
